RSDMX
=======

R package to read SDMX data.

============================

The package is at its earlier stages. It will provide classes and methods to read SDMX data such as Data Structure Definitions (DSDs), Data Structures (KeyFamilies), CodeLists and DataSets.

At now, the package allows to read Datasets for SDMX-ML ``GenericData`` and ``MessageGroup`` types. In the medium-term, it is planned to add parsing of codelists and datasets in ``CompactData`` structure.
